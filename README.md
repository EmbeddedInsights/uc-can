# uC/CAN

The μC/OS CAN module reduces development efforts to embed CAN. Developers need only an understanding of signals, messages and bus configurations. Different abstraction layers can be used independently.

The μC/OS CAN module can communicate via one or more CAN buses simultaneously. The bus management layer organizes the CAN buses and distributes messages to different device drivers. The device driver layer buffers the CAN messages to be sent and received. All hardware dependencies are capsulated in this layer. An embedded target can also have multiple, different CAN controllers.
